# React Js Workshop
## fetching api with axios

## Quick Overview
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via<br> 
**npm install -g create-react-app**,<br>
we recommend you uninstall the package using<br> 
**npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app**<br> 
to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

npm start

### Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx
**npx create-react-app my-app**<br>
(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

### npm
**npm init react-app my-app**

### Yarn
**yarn create react-app my-app**<br>
yarn create <starter-kit-package> is available in Yarn 0.25+

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

# Libraries

    1. axios
    2. styled components

## Installing library

### npm

    npm install axios
    #
    npx install styled-components

### yarn

    yarn add axios
    #
    yarn add styled-components
